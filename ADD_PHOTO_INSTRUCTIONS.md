# How to Add Your Professional Photo

## Step 1: Save Your Image
1. **Right-click** on the professional photo you shared
2. **Save it** as `maryam-profile.jpg` in the `C:\maryam-portfolio\images\` folder
3. **Replace** the existing file if prompted

## Step 2: Image Requirements
- **Filename**: Must be exactly `maryam-profile.jpg`
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (JPG preferred)
- **Size**: Minimum 400x400 pixels
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## Step 3: Verify Display
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Your photo should appear in the hero section
3. If you see an icon instead, check the filename and location

## Current Setup
The portfolio is already configured to display your photo with:
- ✅ Circular cropping
- ✅ Professional border and shadow
- ✅ Hover animations
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Enhanced styling for professional appearance

## Troubleshooting
- **Photo not showing**: Check filename is exactly `maryam-profile.jpg`
- **Photo looks stretched**: Ensure image is square or will be cropped appropriately
- **Slow loading**: Compress image to under 500KB while maintaining quality

Your professional photo will enhance the portfolio's personal touch and professional credibility!
